    "using the standard Python numeric types can be suboptimal for several reasons:\n",
    " - Numbers in Python are objects. Whereas a floating-point number might require\n",

    "defined for, say, efficiently taking the dot product of two vectors, or summing vectors together. Also, Python lists have no way of optimizing the layout of their contents in memory, as they are indexable collections of pointers to Python objects (of any kind, not just numbers). Finally, Python lists are one-dimensional, and\n",
